# Backend Branch
In this branch I'm improving the Item and ItemList components to be more flexible. It can now differentiate 'borrow' and 'lend' requests.
ItemAdder now also exists for borrowing and lending.

I've modified the App.js layout by storing all the screen components in a seperate file, making App.js much much clearer.
I've implemented AsyncStorage for persistent storage of user data.
