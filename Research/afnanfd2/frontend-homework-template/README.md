# Front End Web Development Homework
## Intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

For this week's homework, you will be making a very simple website to display some information about your CS 196 team project. You will need to use some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modify this template site. Your tasks are the following:

1. Create 2 buttons in `index.html` linking to the `authors.html` and `description.html` pages respectively.
2. In `authors.html`, create an unordered list with the names of all the members of your group. Create another unordered list with the names of all the PMs of your group. This PMs list should be in **red, boldfaced** font.
3. In `description.html`, write a brief (2-3 sentence) summary of your project.
4. For some extra credit, add something else to the site. This addition can be whatever you want. Some sugggestions include adding some additional styling to make the website look nicer, adding an extra page, etc. Extra credit will be awarded at your PM's discretion based on the size of the change.

You should work on this assignment in a repository on your own GitHub account and submit a link to your *private* repository on PrairieLearn. **Make sure to add your PM as a reviewer atfer you make a Pull Request.**

As always, please reach out to us on CampusWire, Discord, or at office hours if you have any questions.
