            <p>
                Some Things are too expensive to justify buying for rare or singular occasions, but it'd still be nice to have that Thing. 
                If we can, it's much more reasonable to borrow someone else's Thing instead! Especially if they're not using it any time soon.

                Our project hypothesizes that college students have products that they would like to either borrow or are willing to lend, 
                and our app is intended to make that process easier. Some potential products are books, electronics, almost anything!

            <h2>Minimum Viable Product & Features</h2>
            <p>
                Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a functional Android- and iOS-compatible application that
                has a working user system and can successfully carry out trade and borrowing requests.

                A short list of features that we find crucial are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>A system for users to offer, lend, borrow, etc their items</li>
                    <li>A user-friendly interface for browsing items up for borrowing</li>
                    <li>A communication system so that users may chat and negotiate trades</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section></br>
        <section id="additionalFeatures">
            <h2>Additional Features</h2>
            <p>Given we satisfy the MVP, we have other features in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A points system, where points are gained from trades</li>
                <li>A rating system to rate lenders and borrowers, to gauge overall trustworthiness</li>
                <li>Location services, to better pinpoint users (and their trades) nearby</li>
                <li>An item category system</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>
                    We chose React-Native for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
                    Our team aren't purely Android or iOS users, so React Native was the best choice, since
                it allows for compatibility between both operating systems. It is also a popular framework worth learning.
                    Flask, a Python library, was chosen since it utilizes the Python programming language, which we are 
                currently learning in-course.
