Hello!

Sprint 1: Ended up doing a ton of work on learning JSE6, some React, then React Native. The week was mostly frontend stuff, I haven't touched Flask much beyond installing it.
 
Sprint 2: Learning how to use Flask with React-Native, then using Flask with a mySQL database to implement a page that adds a valid username and a unique email.
